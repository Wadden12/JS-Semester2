            Sharks are much older than dinosaurs. Their ancestry dates back more
            than 400 million years, and they are one of evolutions greatest
            success stories. These animals are uniquely adapted to their ocean
            environment with six highly refined senses of smell, hearing, touch,
            taste, sight, and even electromagnetism. As the top predators in the
            ocean, great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) face only one
            real threat to their survival: us. In some areas great white
            populations have plummeted by over 70%. If not stopped, it could
            lead to the extinction of this ancient species.

            The great white is the sole recognized extant species in the genus
            Carcharodon, and is one of five extant species belonging to the
            family Lamnidae.<sup> <a href="#Ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Other members
            of this family include the mako sharks, porbeagle, and salmon shark.

            Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters
            which have water temperature between 12 and 24 °C (54 and 75 °F),
            with greater concentrations in the United States (Northeast and
            California), South Africa, Japan, Oceania, Chile, and the
            Mediterranean including Sea of Marmara and Bosphorus.<sup>
              <a href="#Ref-4">[4]</a></sup

            One of the densest-known populations is found around Dyer Island,
            South Africa.<sup> <a href="#Ref-5">[5]</a></sup>

            The great white is an epipelagic fish, observed mostly in the
            presence of rich game, such as fur seals, sea lions, cetaceans,
            other sharks, and large bony fish species. In the open ocean, it has
            been recorded at depths as great as 1,200 m (3,900 ft). These
            findings challenge the traditional notion that the great white is a
            coastal species.<sup> <a href="#Ref-6">[6]</a></sup>

              [96] above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and
              gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy, the core
              body temperature can drop to match the surroundings.

              Whilst many think of these beasts as fearsome man-eaters, humans
              aren&#39;t, in fact, on the great white&#39;s menu. There are
              around 5-10 attacks a year, but researchers believe that, rather
              than preying on humans to eat them, the sharks are instead taking
              a “sample bite” out of curiosity, before swimming off.

                  So what do they eat? Well, when they&#39;re young, they feed
                  on small prey, such as fish and rays. But when they&#39;re
                  older and bigger, they generally feast on sea mammals such as
                  sea lions, seals and small whales. Check out this video by

                  Whale carcasses comprise an important part of the diet of
                  white sharks. However, this has rarely been observed due to
                  whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that 30 kg
                  (66 lb) of whale blubber could feed a 4.5 m (15 ft) white
                  shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four
                  whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks
                  were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection,
                  spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale
                  caudal peduncle and fluke, the sharks would investigate the
                  carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several
                  parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding
                  bouts of 15&#45;20 seconds the sharks removed flesh with
                  lateral headshakes, without the protective ocular rotation
                  they employ when attacking live prey.
                </p>
                <p class="Main-P">
                  The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of
                  blubber and immediately returning to feed, possibly in order
                  to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield
                  pieces, using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish
                  them. After feeding for several hours, the sharks appeared to
                  become lethargic, no longer swimming to the surface; they were
                  observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite
                  hard enough to remove flesh, they would instead bounce off and
                  slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding
                  simultaneously, bumping into each other without showing any
                  signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit
                  the head of a neighbouring shark, leaving two teeth embedded,
                  but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals
                  hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away.
                  Unusually for the area, large numbers of sharks over five
                  metres long were observed, suggesting that the largest sharks
                  change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the
                  manoeuvrability required to hunt seals.

              Great white sharks were previously thought to reach sexual

              far longer; male great white sharks reach sexual maturity at age
              26, while females take 33 years to reach sexual
              maturity.[9][130][131] Maximum life span was originally believed
              to be more than 30 years, but a study by the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution placed it at upwards of 70 years.

              age of 73 years and a maximum female age of 40 years for the

              reproductive rate, long gestation period of 11 months and slow
              growth make it vulnerable to pressures such as overfishing and

              Of all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by
              far the largest number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans,
              with 272 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of
              2012. <sup><a href="#Ref-16">[16]</a></sup>

              More than any documented bite incident, Peter Benchley's
              best-selling novel Jaws and the subsequent 1975 film adaptation
              directed by Steven Spielberg provided the great white shark with
              the image of being a "man-eater" in the public mind.
              <sup><a href="#Ref-17">[17]</a></sup> While great white sharks
              have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked bite
              incidents, they typically do not target them: for example, in the
              Mediterranean Sea there have been 31 confirmed bite incidents
              against humans in the last two centuries, most of which were
              non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be "test-bites". Great
              white sharks also test-bite buoys, flotsam, and other unfamiliar
              objects, and they might grab a human or a surfboard to identify
              what it is.

              Shark culling is the deliberate killing of sharks by a government
              in an attempt to reduce shark attacks; shark culling is often
              called "shark control".These programs have been criticized by
              environmentalists and scientists—they say these programs harm the
              marine ecosystem; they also say such programs are "outdated,
              cruel, and ineffective". Many different species (dolphins,
              turtles, etc.) are also killed in these programs (because of their
              use of shark nets and drum lines)—15,135 marine animals were
              killed in New South Wales' nets between 1950 and 2008, and 84,000
              marine animals were killed by Queensland authorities from 1962 to
              2015. <sup><a href="#Ref-18">[18]</a></sup>

              In 2014 the state government of Western Australia led by Premier
              Colin Barnett implemented a policy of killing large sharks. The
              policy, colloquially referred to as the Western Australian shark
              cull, was intended to protect users of the marine environment from
              shark bite incidents, following the deaths of seven people on the
              Western Australian coastline in the years 2010&#45;2013. Baited
              drum lines were deployed near popular beaches using hooks designed
              to catch great white sharks, as well as bull and tiger sharks.
              Large sharks found hooked but still alive were shot and their
              bodies discarded at sea. The government claimed they were not
              culling the sharks, but were using a "targeted, localised, hazard
              mitigation strategy".
              <sup><a href="#Ref-19">[19]</a></sup> Barnett described opposition
              as "ludicrous" and "extreme", and said that nothing could change
              his mind.[163] This policy was met with widespread condemnation
              from the scientific community, which showed that species
              responsible for bite incidents were notoriously hard to identify,
              that the drum lines failed to capture white sharks, as intended,
              and that the government also failed to show any correlation
              between their drum line policy and a decrease in shark bite
              incidents in the region. <sup><a href="#Ref-20">[20]</a></sup>

              Cage diving is most common at sites where great whites are
              frequent including the coast of South Africa, the Neptune Islands
              in South Australia, <sup><a href="#Ref-21">[21]</a></sup> and
              Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving
              and swimming with sharks is at the focus of a booming tourist
              industry. <sup><a href="#Ref-22">[22]</a></sup> A common practice
              is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks.
              These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their
              environment and to associate human activity with food; a
              potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards
              the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly
              striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the
              bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the
              divers.

            It is unclear how much of a concurrent increase in fishing for great
            white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations
            from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers
            are available, but the great white shark is now considered
            vulnerable. <sup><a href="#Ref-24">[24]</a></sup> Sharks taken
            during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never
            reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.

          <p class="Main-P">
            The IUCN notes that very little is known about the actual status of
            the great white shark, but as it appears uncommon compared to other
            widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is
            included in Appendix II of CITES,[15] meaning that international
            trade in the species (including parts and derivatives) requires a
            permit. <sup><a href="#Ref-25">[25]</a></sup> As of March 2010, it
            has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU,
            which strives for increased international understanding and
            coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks.
            <sup><a href="#Ref-26">[26]</a></sup> A February 2010 study by
            Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population
            of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the
            species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose
            population is in the same range.
            <sup><a href="Ref-27">[27]</a></sup> According to another study from
            2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History,
            University of Florida, there are about 2,000 great white sharks near
            the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous
            estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.

              The Australasian population of great white sharks is believed to
              be in excess of 8,000&#45;10,000 individuals according to genetic
              research studies done by CSIRO, with an adult population estimated
              to be around 2,210 individuals in both Eastern and Western
              Australia. The annual survival rate for juveniles in these two
              separate populations was estimated in the same study to be close
              to 73 percent, while adult sharks had a 93 percent annual survival
              rate. Whether or not mortality rates in great white sharks have
              declined, or the population has increased as a result of the
              protection of this species in Australian waters is as yet unknown
              due to the slow growth rates of this species.

              As of April 2007, great white sharks were fully protected within
              370 km (230 mi) of New Zealand and additionally from fishing by
              New Zealand-flagged boats outside this range. The maximum penalty
              is a $250,000 fine and up to six months in prison.
              <sup><a href="#Ref-31">[31]</a></sup> In June 2018 the New Zealand
              Department of Conservation classified the great white shark under
              the New Zealand Threat Classification System as "Nationally
              Endangered". The species meets the criteria for this
              classification as there exists a moderate, stable population of
              between 1000 and 5000 mature individuals. This classification has
              the qualifiers "Data Poor" and "Threatened Overseas".

              In 2013, great white sharks were added to California's Endangered
              Species Act. From data collected, the population of great whites
              in the North Pacific was estimated to be fewer than 340
              individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically
              distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa,
              Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been
              isolated from other populations.
              <sup><a href="#Ref-32">[32]</a></sup>

              A 2014 study estimated the population of great white sharks along
              the California coastline to be approximately 2,400. In 2015
              Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing
              decoys, or baiting and chumming for its significant and highly
              predictable migratory great white population without an
              appropriate research permit. The goal of these restrictions is to
              both protect the sharks and public health.
